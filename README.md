# [Physics Experiment 1](https://dkallen78.github.io/physics-experiment-1/physics-exp-1.html)

I wanted to make a gravity simulation. I've been reading Neal Stephenson's Baroque
Cycle and the Isaac Newton character talking about celestial mechanics reminded me
of [another project](https://dkallen78.github.io/neo-finder/sentry/sentry.html) I
made that drew existing orbits with SVG ellipses. Ever since then I've had it in
the back of my mind to do a simulation.

This is all based on the equation for gravity based on Newton's work:

## F = G * ((m<sub>1</sub> * m<sub>2</sub>) / rÂ²)

### Where F is force or change in velocity

### G is the gravitational constant which is 6.674 * 10<sup>-11</sup>

### m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> are the masses of the two objects, and

### r is the distance between those objects.

There's still some things I don't understand
about trigonometry but what I've built works for now.
