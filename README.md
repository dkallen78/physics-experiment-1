# [Physics Experiment 1](https://dkallen78.github.io/physics-experiment-1/physics-exp-1.html)

I wanted to make a gravity simulation. I've been reading Neal Stephenson's Baroque
Cycle and the Isaac Newton character talking about celestial mechanics reminded me
of [another project](https://dkallen78.github.io/neo-finder/sentry/sentry.html) I
made that drew existing orbits with SVG ellipses. Ever since then I've had it in
the back of my mind to do a simulation.

This is all based on the equation for gravity based on Newton's work:

F = G * ((m<sub>1</sub> * m<sub>2</sub>) / r²)

There's still some things I don't understand
about trigonometry but what I've built works for now.
